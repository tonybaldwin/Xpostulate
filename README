DEPENDENCIES:

Xpostulate only works if you have a blog
Wordpress, Tumblr, Livejournal, InsaneJournal, Dreamwidth journal...etc.

Additionally Xpostulate requires:
Tcl8.5
Tk8.5
and
tcllib for http and base64

Get it here:
http://www.activestate.com/store/productdetail.aspx?prdGuid=f0cd6399-fefb-466e-ba17-220dcd6f4078
or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/

Most modern Linux OSes already have tcl, some still have 8.4, others have the new 8.5.  
You want 8.5.

----

Xpostulate should function on Linux, Mac OS and Windows, but, 
Installers for lin and win are available from the main site.
I believe it will also work on Mac OS and BSD without issue,
but no installers have been built (install from sources).

----
MANUAL

There is a manual here: http://baldwinsoftware.com/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Xpost.Manual
There are user communities on LJ and DW

# changelog for v 0.2.1
# #############
SUPPORT FOR FRIENDIKA POSTING WITH BBCODE INSERTIONS!!!
Removed twitter (needs work...anybody want to help me with oauth?)
Changed identi.ca to any status.net
Removed iziblog, scribbld, and inksome...sorry...
those sites have become a haven of SEO spam, anyway.
If somebody wants this function back, contact me
at tony@baldwinsoftware.com, and for a large fee, I will write
you a custom spammy xpostulator.


----
If you like Xpostulate and want to drop me a line to say thanks,
go ahead and e-mail me at tony@baldwinsoftware.com
Likewise, do the same if you have any questions about using Xpostulate,
and/or suggestions for new features, or, you want to participate
in the future development thereof.
Of course, since it's all GPLed code, you could take what I've done
and run with it, too, if you like, so long as you release your
work under the GPL.

If you have complaints, call 1-800-YO-MOMMA

Be well,
Tony
